<h1> ACS Rewritten (Alpha) </h1>
<p> I created this project during my time at school. It's a semi-fully rewritten version of the Advanced Combat System 2.0 (ACS) from the client side. The original framework wasn't bad, but it was unoptimized and poorly written, with all the client-side code in one file (over 3000 lines ðŸ¤¯). So, I rewrote the essential functions and optimized it a little bit :). </p>

<h1> Important! </h1>
<p> The GitHub repository only contains the source code for the project. To use it, you need to download the Release (.RBLX File). </p>
<p> Please note that this project is no longer supported and has been abandoned. I don't have much time now, as I am working on other projects. Feel free to use this project in any way you like. </p>
